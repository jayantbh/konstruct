	<h2>West Bengal University of Technology</h2>
	<h3>A Brief History</h3>
	<p>The West Bengal University of Technology came into existence on August 5, 2000. The University in-house department first started as IIIT-C. Later on, with the need of the industry and policies taken by State Government, for a higher quality engineering and technology education, School of Engineering and Technology - WBUT was formed along with School of Biotechnology &amp Biological Sciences, School of Management &amp Natural Sciences. 
The University which began its operation only with 30 colleges, now has strength of 217 colleges. The increase of Post Graduate courses and R&ampD activity has provided the University an edge advantage and helped the education arena to meet the gap of future Human Resource in Education. The University is continuously and effortlessly busy in up gradation of Education in West Bengal with the help of UGC, AICTE and State Government.
In the last decade, WBUT being a Centre of Excellence for higher studies and research, engaged in National Building Exercise.

	<h2>Konstruct - Open Source Fest</h2>
	<h3>Open Source at WBUT</h3>
	<p>Open source as a development model promotes a universal access via a free license to a product's design or blueprint, and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint, including subsequent improvements to it by anyone. Opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive communities.<br>
At Konstruct 2015 we the students of WBUT have endeavored to capture this spirit by bringing together stalwarts in the field of OSS like Mozilla, Linux Users Group, and Java Users Group. <br>
We also are proud to announce that this event will mark a new chapter of DEFCON India (or NULL) based out of Kolkata! <br>
Internshala will be present to share their pearls of wisdom with us, and last but definitely not the least we have Jimmy Tangree for India Records hosting a seminar for us on the second day.<br>
As Kolkata's first Open Source Fest kicks off the great words of Linus Torvalds once again comes to mind:<br><b><i>&quotTalk is cheap. Show me the code.&quot</i></b><br>Enjoy!</p>
